D) how to know size of the company in stock market? what is market capitalization?
    1) kaise decide kre konsi company ka market capitalization kitna hai?
    market capitalization is shows the size of the compony.
    for example: 
        TATA Cunsaltancy Services = 2049 share price
        MRF = 54045 share price
        which compony is big......???
        hum yahi sochte hai ki jiska share price jada woh company badi honi chahiye but aisa nhi hai....

    2) market capitalization formula :
        market capitalization = share price X total number of share
        Example : 
            supose we have compony : ABC
            total number of share = 100 Cr 
            price of share = 50 Rs 

            market capitalization = share price X total number of share
            ABC market capitalization = 50 X 100 Cr
            ABC market capitalization = 5,000 Cr Rs

            AND 

            compony name =  XYZ
            total number of share = 1000 Cr
            price of share = 30 Rs 

            market capitalization = share price X total number of share
            XYZ market capitalization = 30 X 1000 Cr
            XYZ market capitalization = 30,000 Cr Rs

            so which compony size is big ABC or XYZ... Obviously XYZ is a bigger than ABC
    
    3) Lets jump to point number 1.

        TATA Cunsaltancy Services = 375 Cr total share
        market capitalization = share price X total number of share
        TATA Cunsaltancy Services market capitalization = 2094 X 375 Cr
        TATA Cunsaltancy Services market capitalization = 7,98,281.25 Cr Rs

        MRF = 42,40,000 total share
        market capitalization = share price X total number of share
        MRF market capitalization = 54045 X 4240000
        MRF market capitalization = 22,502 Cr rs 

        it means TATA Cunsaltancy Services is bigger than MRF
